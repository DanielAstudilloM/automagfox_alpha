README

This program is a Python script designed to automate the work with the MAGFOX program. **THIS SCRIPT IS THE VERSION UTILIZED FOR PUBLISHING OF THE "DIFFERENTIATION TRENDS IN THE LUNAR CRUST" MANUSCRIPT BY STEPHEN M. ELARDO AND DANIEL ASTUDILLO MANOSALVA, SUBMITTED TO GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA IN 2022. THIS VERSION WAS WRITTEN WITH MINIMAL FUNCTIONALITY AND IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THE WORK DONE IN THE PUBLICATION AND WE CANNOT ENSURE IT WILL PROVIDE GOOD RESULTS OUTSIDE OF THE DESIGNED CONDITIONS**.

A new version will be released through a new publication later along with similar scripts for MAGPOX, pMELTS and Perple_X. These versions will include complete documentation and will have better functionality and optimization. If you wish to make use of these, keep an eye out for my following publications and of my github repositories at https://github.com/DanielAstudilloM

MAGFOX is a program written by John Longhi and colaborators designed to model fractional crystallization in peridotitic rocks and is freely available as part of the SPICES suite of programs at the LPI website https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/tools/crystallizationcalculation/. We do not include the program here as it was not published with a public license and therefore we legally cannot distribute the code, modified code or binaries. 

For the script to run however, it is necessary to download MAGFOX from the LPI website and recompile an edited version of the program. Detailed instructions are included in the INSTRUCTIONS.md file in this same repository.

For questions about the functionality of the code please contact me at daniel.astudillo@ufl.edu

Good luck
Daniel
